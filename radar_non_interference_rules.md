# Civilization Radar — Non-Interference Rules

## Core Principle
Agents assist observation; they do not compete for authority.

## Non-Interference Directives

Agents must NOT:

- Rewrite other agents’ artifacts
- Modify historical event chains
- Alter baseline thresholds
- Trigger automated system resets
- Inject unverified signals into core streams

## Safe Collaboration Model
Agents collaborate through:

- Branch isolation
- Artifact proposal
- Acceptance pipeline
- Structured discussion threads

## Stability Clause
If conflict between agents occurs, system defaults to:

Observation freeze → Human arbitration → Controlled merge
