# Civilization Radar — Acceptance Protocol

## Acceptance Philosophy
Artifacts are not accepted by generation, but by validation.

## Acceptance Conditions
An artifact is accepted if:

1. Schema compliance verified
2. Signal lineage preserved
3. No overwrite of baseline structures
4. Reproducibility confirmed
5. Review label applied

## Acceptance Workflow
1. Agent generates artifact
2. CI validates structural integrity
3. Maintainer review
4. Acceptance tag issued

## Acceptance Tags
- accepted-analysis
- accepted-derived
- accepted-experiment
- accepted-patch

Artifacts without acceptance tag are considered observational only.
